The Tractor is a vehicle that differs slightly from the traditional cars you will spot on the freeway. They travel
faster than traditional cars and when they interact with another vehicle they shove it to the side. There is a 50% 
chance the vehicle is pushed up and a 50% chance the vehicle is pushed down. Make sure to watch out for the tractor
or else it might throw a car in front of you and ruin your run.
